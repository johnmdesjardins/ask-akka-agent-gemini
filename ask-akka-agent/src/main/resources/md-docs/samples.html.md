## [](about:blank#_maven_archetype) Maven archetype

To create the build structure of a new service you can use the Maven archetype. From a command window, in the parent directory of the new service, run the following:

Linux or macOS
```command
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.akka \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=akka-javasdk-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion=3.3.0
```

Windows 10+
```command
mvn archetype:generate ^
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.akka ^
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=akka-javasdk-archetype ^
  -DarchetypeVersion=3.3.0
```

The [Author your first Akka service](author-your-first-service.html) starts from the Maven archetype and lets you implement a very simple service.
