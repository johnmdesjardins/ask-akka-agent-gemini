# akka container-registry push

Push an Akka service image for a particular Akka project.

## Synopsis

The `akka container-registry push _image_` command will push the given container image to the Akka container registry.
The provided image name must be a valid Docker image tag and not an image hash/SHA-256.

This command will replace the `HOST[:PORT_NUMBER]` portion of the specified _image_ with the appropriate Akka container registry hostname if it does not match the expected hostname.
This command is also multi-region aware.
If the current (or specified) Akka project is a multi-region project, the provided _image_ will be tagged with a new tag for each Akka region where the project resides and this command will push the image to each of those regions for you.

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE**\
You must have the source _image_ in your local Docker service image catalog for this command to function.
If the image is not locally stored, you can pull it (via `docker pull _image_` first       before running this command.

```
akka container-registry push IMAGE [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help             help for push
      --owner string     the owner of the project to use, needed if you have two projects with the same name from different owners
      --project string   project to use if not using the default configured project
```

```
      --cache-file string   location of cache file (default "~/.akka/cache.yaml")

      --context string      configuration context to use

                            This is equivalent to setting the environment variable AKKA_DISABLE_PROMPTS to true.
