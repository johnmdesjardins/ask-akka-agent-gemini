# Akka HTTP rapid reset denial of service

## Date

2023-10-16

## CVE

CVE-2023-44487

## Description of Vulnerability

A widespread HTTP/2 server vulnerability where a client issues rapid HTTP/2 reset frames and thereby  sidesteps the protection against unlimited resource consumption built into the protocol.

## Severity

The CVSS score of this vulnerability is 7.5, based on vector [(AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1).

## Impact

The quick sequence of requests can possibly trigger of expensive requests on the server,  depending on the application logic built on top of Akka HTTP/2, at a low cost for the abusing client, allowing for denial of service attacks.

Akka HTTP/2 servers running behind a proxy are likely protected by the proxy, given that it has protective measurements against this vulnerability.

## Resolution

Starting from Akka HTTP 10.5.3 a reset frame rate limit is present in the HTTP/2 server.
The rate limit is configurable through settings `akka.http.server.http2.max-resets` and `akka.http.server.http2.max-resets-interval` with a default limit of 400 resets per 10s and connection.
Once a connection hits the limit it is closed.

## Affected versions

* All Akka HTTP versions prior to `10.5.3`

## Fixed versions

* Akka HTTP 10.5.3
