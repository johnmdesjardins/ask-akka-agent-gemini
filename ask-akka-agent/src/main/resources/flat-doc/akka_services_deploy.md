# akka services deploy

Deploy a service to the currently configured project.

## Synopsis

The `akka service deploy _service-name_ _docker-image_` command deploys a service with name _service-name_ using the _docker-image_.
This command is meant for rapid experimentation and development.
For production use cases, we recommend deploying through a service descriptor, using the `akka service apply` command.

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE**\
If using a private image repository, you will need Docker credentials to be set up in order for Akka to be able to pull from your images.
For more info see `akka docker`

```

      --min-instances int32         the minimum number of instances of a service that should be available. Must be greater than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 10, and less than or equal to max-instances. Defaults to 3. Not available for trial projects. (default -1)
