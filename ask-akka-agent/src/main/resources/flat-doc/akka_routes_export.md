# akka routes export

Export a single route as YAML

## Synopsis

The `akka routes export` command will export a route as YAML, so that it can be stored in a version control system, edited, and reapplied with the update -f command.

```
akka routes export NAME [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --all-regions      run the command on all regions
  -h, --help             help for export
      --owner string     the owner of the project to use, needed if you have two projects with the same name from different owners
      --project string   project to use if not using the default configured project
      --region string    region to use if project has more than one region
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --cache-file string   location of cache file (default "~/.akka/cache.yaml")
      --config string       location of config file (default "~/.akka/config.yaml")
      --context string      configuration context to use
      --disable-prompt      Disable all interactive prompts when running akka commands. If input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.
                            This is equivalent to setting the environment variable AKKA_DISABLE_PROMPTS to true.
  -o, --output string       set output format to one of [text,json,go-template=] (default "text")
  -q, --quiet               set quiet output (helpful when used as part of a script)
      --timeout duration    client command timeout (default 10s)
      --use-grpc-web        use grpc-web when talking to Akka APIs. This is useful when behind corporate firewalls that decrypt traffic but don't support HTTP/2.
  -v, --verbose             set verbose output
```
