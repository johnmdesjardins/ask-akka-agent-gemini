# akka roles add-binding

Add a role binding.

## Synopsis

The command `akka roles add-binding` grants a user access to a project.

The user may be referenced by either their user ID, username, or email.
If using username or email, the user must already be a member either of the project or the projectâ€™s owning organization, otherwise the user may be invited by their email address.
