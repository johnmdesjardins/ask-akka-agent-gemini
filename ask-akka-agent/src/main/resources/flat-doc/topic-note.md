Only topic names are referenced and no additional details about how to connect to the topics are needed. When deploying the application there must be a broker configuration in the Akka project, with credentials and details on how connect to the broker. For details about configuring a broker see [Configure message brokers](operations:projects/message-brokers.adoc).
